Git Workflow

A git project can be thought of having three parts. 

1. Working directory: All the work is done here like creating, editing, deleting and organizing files.

2. Staging area: Where you list changes made in the working directory.

3. Repository: Git permanently stores the changes as different versions of the project.

The git workflow consists of editing files in the working directory, adding files to the staging area and saving changes to the git repository. We save these chnges using commit.:
